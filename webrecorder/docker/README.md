This branch of this fork is intended to track the master branch
webrecorder/webrecorder and provide a mechanism for building a basic
webrecorder image for use in the Perma ecosystem.

The present code was used to generate the image
harvardlil/webrecorder:0.03, with the command line

```
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t harvardlil/webrecorder:0.03 
```

Subsequent commits will include a changelog.
